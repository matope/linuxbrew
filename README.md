A fork of Homebrew for Linux

Install Linuxbrew (tl;dr)
-------------------------

Paste at a Terminal prompt:

``` sh
ruby -e "$(wget -O- https://raw.github.com/Homebrew/linuxbrew/go/install)"
```

See [Dependencies](#dependencies) and [Installation](#installation) below for more details.

Features
--------

+ Can install software to a home directory and so does not require sudo
+ Install software not packaged by the native distribution
+ Install up-to-date versions of software when the native distribution is old
+ Use the same package manager to manage both your Mac and Linux machines

Dependencies
------------

* **Ruby** 1.8.6 or newer
+ **GCC** 4.2 or newer

Paste at a Terminal prompt:

### Debian or Ubuntu

```sh
sudo apt-get install build-essential curl git m4 ruby texinfo libbz2-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev libexpat-dev libncurses-dev zlib1g-dev
```

### Fedora

```sh
sudo yum groupinstall 'Development Tools' && sudo yum install curl git m4 ruby irb texinfo bzip2-devel curl-devel expat-devel ncurses-devel zlib-devel
```

Installation
------------

Paste at a Terminal prompt:

``` sh
ruby -e "$(wget -O- https://raw.github.com/Homebrew/linuxbrew/go/install)"
```

Or if you prefer:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Homebrew/linuxbrew.git ~/.linuxbrew
```

Add to your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`:

```sh
export PATH="$HOME/.linuxbrew/bin:$PATH"
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$HOME/.linuxbrew/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH"

Something broke!
----------------

Many of the Homebrew formulae work on either Mac or Linux without changes, but
some formulae will need to be adapted for Linux. If a formula doesn't work,
[open an issue on GitHub][issues] or, even better, submit a pull request.
